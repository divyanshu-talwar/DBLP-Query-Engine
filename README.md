# DBLP-Query-Engine
## About
Led team of 2 (comprising me and Divyanshu Talwar) to create a GUI-equipped query engine in Java/Swing for DBLP bibliography (âˆ¼2.6GB). We added the following functionalities to the application:
1. Search query on publication title or author name with option to filter/sort output via date, relevance.
2. Query to find authors having more than a given number of publications (handled alias names).
3. Given a data upto a particular year, predicting the number of papers an
author publishes in the next year.
4. Generated documentation from annotated Java source using [Doxygen].


* This is GUI-based DBLP Query Engine implemented as a part of the CSE 201 Course taken in Monsoon 2016 at [IIIT-Delhi].
